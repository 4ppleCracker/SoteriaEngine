Day 1:

Got rendering working with minimalist code in the game.

Rectangle rect = new Rectangle() { x = 10, y = 10, width = 100, height = 150, color = Color.Red, filled = true };
Window window = new Window("Hello World", 640, 480);
while (window.Running) {
    window.Poll();
    window.Draw(rect);
    window.Update();
}

tomorrow i will automate the loop aswell as add a Draw function and Update function in the game, which will probably be a class inheriting SoteriaEngine.Game

Day 2:

Fixed rendering. added texture and transparency support

i added gameobject which you can inherit from to gain access to Update and Start methods.
GameObject are automatically rendered with a drawable field which you pass in the constructor.

There's also now a Input class which contains what keys a pressed, held or released on that frame 
and a Time class which contain DeltaTime(frame difference in ms) and FPS

this is how it looks like to get a game running now

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        Game game = new Game();
        game.Start(title: "Hello World", width: 640, height: 480);
    }
}
class Player : SoteriaEngine.GameObject
{
    public Player(Drawable drawable, string name = "") : base(drawable, name) {}

    protected override void Start() {
    }

    protected override void Update() {
        int speed = 5;
        if (Input.KeyDown(Input.Key.w)) {
            Move(0, -speed);
        }
        if (Input.KeyDown(Input.Key.d)) {
            Move(speed, 0);
        }
        if (Input.KeyDown(Input.Key.a)) {
            Move(-speed, 0);
        }
        if (Input.KeyDown(Input.Key.s)) {
            Move(0, speed);
        }
    }
}
class Game : SoteriaEngine.Game
{
    protected override void Load() {
        Add(new Player(new DrawableTexture("test.png")));
        Background = new DrawableTexture(new Texture("Track1A.png", Width, Height), Width, Height);
    }
    protected override void Draw(Window window) {
    }
    protected override void Update() {
            
    }
}

this would've taken so much more time and way uglier using Day 1 engine.

current lines of code is 278(Code Metrics Results)

tomorrow i am gonna add more features and try to make a working tower defense example game
